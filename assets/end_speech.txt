In all seriousness though, I appreciate the effort that y'all have put in to 
adapt to the sudden changes. I understand it mustn't be easy to manage so 
many changes to the curriculum all at once. For the most part, I think you've
all shown that you care about our wellbeing. 

That being said, I think the team could be more decisive. I'm referring to 
the removal of support for external libraries. There were good reasons to 
make that call. But it would have been greatly appreciated if it were made 
earlier. (That being said, if you're interested in a "space invaders" type 
game controlled by body movements via camera ala kinect, check out my github. 
Extra credit appreciated.)
